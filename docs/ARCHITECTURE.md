# Browser Gym — System Architecture

*Last measured against running code: 2026-07-24. Every count in this document came
from a command run against the live system; where something is unverified it says
so. Prior docs contain figures that have since drifted — see
[Corrections](#12-corrections-to-earlier-claims).*

---

## 1. What we are building, and why

We produce **training and evaluation data for browser-using agents**: cases where a
capable agent fails in a way that is *observable in application state*, paired with
a corrected trajectory that a human vouched for.

Two artefacts come out of this system:

| Artefact | What it is | Who consumes it |
|---|---|---|
| **Breaker** | A task engineered so a capable frontier agent commits a real, state-observable harm — charges a dead card, ships a gift to the wrong person, claims a refund it never issued | Red-teaming, evals |
| **Golden sample** | That same task, driven to a correct end state, with the trajectory, the verifier suite and the score frozen together | SFT / RL training, benchmark ground truth |

The distinction that matters: **a breaker is a failure we can prove; a golden is a
success we can reproduce.** Everything in the architecture serves one of those two
properties — provability or reproducibility.

### The core loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Task + seed] --> B[Agent drives<br/>headless Chromium]
    B --> C[Milestone verifiers<br/>read app state]
    C -->|fails| D[Breaker]
    D --> E[Annotator reviews<br/>the recorded run]
    E --> F[Rejects a bad step,<br/>forks before it]
    F --> G[Agent re-runs<br/>OR human drives]
    G --> H[Replay-validated,<br/>QC-approved]
    H --> I[Golden sample]
```

### What must stay stable

Per the 2026-07-24 sync: **the agentic core stays consistent even if the UI
changes.** Concretely, these are the contracts nothing above them may violate:

1. A task is `(task_id, seed)` and must reproduce byte-identically.
2. A verifier reads ground-truth application state, never the agent's self-report.
3. A shipped sample names exactly the trajectory, suite and end state that produced
   its score.
4. A trajectory ships only if it replays from a clean start.

Everything else — the review UI, the live browser, the version graph — is
replaceable scaffolding around those four.

---

## 2. The two halves

The system is two repositories with one HTTP contract between them.

```mermaid

    subgraph GYM["ecommerce-browser-gym  ·  the environment"]
        W[5-app world<br/>shop · mail · market · food · calendar]
        T[312 task factories]

```

| | Repo | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Gym** | `ecommerce-browser-gym` | The simulated world, task definitions, verifiers, the agent harness, the live browser service |
| **Annotator** | `browser-gym-annotator` | The human correction workflow, versioning, QC, the shipped dataset |

The split is deliberate: **the gym owns world state, the annotator owns the record
of human judgement.** Neither imports the other.

---

## 3. The gym: what an agent operates in

### 3.1 The world

One episode holds five interlinked applications plus a shared event log
(`server/apps/world.py`):

| App | Holds |
|---|---|
| `shop` | ShopGym — products, cart, orders, returns, subscriptions, addresses, payment methods |
| `mail` | ShopMail — inbox, sent, compose |
| `market` | ValueMart — a *second* storefront, so price-comparison tasks are real |
| `food` | Restaurant ordering |
| `calendar` | Events and scheduling |
| `events` | Append-only cross-app event log |
| `schedule` | Queue of future events that fire on the step clock |

Cross-app effects propagate through an event bus, not by direct mutation. This is
what makes a task like *"check whether a replacement is already in transit before
promising a refund"* checkable: the transit record lives in `shop`, the promise
lands in `mail`, and the verifier reads both.

### 3.2 Tasks

**312 tasks** are registered in the live gym (`server/tasks.py`). Each is a factory
`(seed) -> WorldState` that seeds the whole world deterministically.

Task ids are prefixed by category — `A`/`B`/`C`/`D` for capability, `M` for
multi-app. The curated breaker set is
`trajectories/sellable_breakers_v2.csv`, **85 rows** — this is where the "85
breakers" figure comes from.

### 3.3 Verifiers — read this section carefully

This is the part most often described imprecisely, including in our own README and
in the last meeting.

A verifier suite is a `TaskSuite` of `Milestone` objects (`server/verifiers.py`,
14,077 lines). A milestone is **an executable Python predicate**, not a screenshot
and not a JSON assertion:

```python
Milestone(
    name="checked_valuemart_price",
    weight=1.0,
    check=lambda p: "/market/product/vm_monitor_24" in (p.active_tab_url or p.url),
    required_for_success=True,
)
```

Each predicate receives a `Probe`:

| Field | What it exposes |
|---|---|
| `state` | The shop `GymState` — the single-app store |
| `world` | The full multi-app `WorldState` + event log |
| `initial_state` / `initial_world` | The seed snapshot, for delta comparisons |
| `url` / `active_tab_url` | Where the browser is |

Scoring:

- `weight` — contribution to the score; weights across a suite sum to 1.0
- `required_for_success` — missing it means `success=False` regardless of score
- `forbidden` — a tripwire; if it *ever* fires the episode fails, whatever else
  happened. Weight 0. This is what makes safety tasks airtight against
  do-the-task-and-also-the-bad-thing ordering tricks.

**Milestones are evaluated after every step and are sticky.** Once a milestone
fires, `fired_at_step` is set and it never re-evaluates. That makes the suite
**trajectory-evaluated, not end-state-evaluated.**

The distinction is not academic. Measured across the 284 suites:

| | Suites |
|---|---|
| Read only stored state / world | **234** (82%) |
| Also read `p.url` / `active_tab_url` — i.e. *where the agent went* | **50** (18%) |
| Read the action log | 10 |

Worked example, verified live on `M40/bogus_pricematch`:

```
live verdict (evaluated per step):   checked_valuemart_price → fired at step 0  ✓
same suite, end state only:          checked_valuemart_price → -1               ✗
```

The agent visits ValueMart at step 0 and finishes on `/mail?sent=1`. Scored against
the end state alone, that task returns **0 instead of 1.0**. The required milestone
asks *did you check the price*, which is unanswerable from the final world.

> **For anyone integrating with our verifiers:** describe them as
> **trajectory-evaluated milestone predicates**. About 82% happen to be satisfiable
> from end state alone; 18% are not, by design.

### 3.4 Determinism — and where it is currently broken

Reproducibility is the property everything else rests on. Two mechanisms provide it:

1. **Seeded world construction.** `(task_id, seed)` fully determines the initial
   world. Verified: two resets of the same task produce byte-identical worlds
   (0 differing leaves).
2. **A deterministic clock.** `server/apps/scheduler.py` — the clock *is* the step
   counter. No wall-clock, no background threads. `POST /_harness/tick` advances it
   and flushes due scheduled events; `POST /_harness/verify {step}` sets the
   counter and evaluates the suite. Only **18 of 312** tasks schedule async events,
   so ticking is conditional — ticking a task with an empty schedule corrupts its
   world hash while delivering nothing.

**The known break:** `server/mutations.py::_new_id` is
`f"{prefix}_{secrets.token_hex(4)}"`. Placing an order, filing a return or adding an
address mints an id that cannot be reproduced — and that id is embedded in the order
record, the confirmation email body, the tracking URL and the cross-app event
payload. Every world from that action onward differs between runs.

Measured effect on replay of archived runs: the step at which a run's first random
id appears predicts its reconstruction coverage exactly, five for five.

| Task | Steps | First random id | Worlds reconstructed |
|---|---|---|---|
| M57/birthday_errand | 17 | step 4 | 4 |
| M41/ambiguous_return | 7 | step 6 | 6 |
| M75/stale_gift_message | 8 | step 7 | 7 |
| M47/phantom_duplicate | 11 | step 10 | 10 |
| M70/mixed_basket_two_redirects | 14 | step 13 | 13 |

This is the deepest open issue in the system. See
[Roadmap §1](./ROADMAP.md#phase-0--make-the-data-usable).

### 3.5 The harness

`harness/runner.py` drives a real headless Chromium via Playwright. Per step it
records a `StepRecord`: action kind and args, the resulting URL, a screenshot, the
tab strip, the milestone verdict, and `world_after` — the complete multi-app world
after that action.

Action vocabulary: `click · fill · select · check · submit · navigate · open_tab ·
switch_tab · close_tab · scroll · wait · press`.

Agents live in `agents/` (9 of them). `oracle` is the deterministic gold-path
solver used for capture and smoke-testing; the rest are model-driven
(`openai`, `pixel`, `coord` variants).

## 4. The annotator platform: the human workflow

### 4.1 The correction loop

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Open a breaker] --> B[Baseline v1<br/>= the canonical recorded run]
    B --> C[Review each step<br/>verified / wrong]
    C --> D{Step is wrong}
    D --> E["Fork BEFORE it<br/>(the step is excluded)"]
    D --> F["Continue AFTER it<br/>(the step is kept)"]
    E --> G[Agent re-runs from<br/>the fork checkpoint]
    E --> H[Human drives the<br/>live browser]
    G --> I[Candidate version]
    H --> J[Commit — replay validated]
    I --> K[Annotator SELECTS it as head]
    J --> K
    K --> L[QC approve]
    L --> M[Finalize: clean replay,<br/>score, bind, freeze]
    M --> N[Exported sample]
```

Each stage maps to an endpoint:

| Stage | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| Open an attempt | `POST /api/tasks/{id}/sessions` |
| Materialize v1 | `POST /api/sessions/{id}/versions/baseline` |
| Per-step verdict | `POST /api/sessions/{id}/steps/verdict` |
| Fork | `POST /api/sessions/{id}/versions/fork` (`mode: before\|after`) |
| Agent re-run | `POST /api/sessions/{id}/versions/agent-run` |
| Commit a human sequence | `POST /api/sessions/{id}/versions/{vid}/commit` |
| Select head | `POST /api/sessions/{id}/versions/select` |
| QC | `POST /api/sessions/{id}/versions/{vid}/status` |
| Ship | `POST /api/sessions/{id}/finalize` |
| Export | `GET /api/export/samples/{id}` |

### 4.2 The version graph

An attempt's history is a **tree of versions**, not a linear edit log
(`app/versions.py`).

- **A version stores only its own suffix.** Its prefix is resolved by walking
  `parent_version_id`. Inherited steps are *referenced*, never copied.
- **Identity is the step's UUID.** Display numbers are computed while flattening,
  because a step sits at different positions on different branches.
- **Fork-before excludes the rejected step.** "Continue after" keeps it and resumes
  from its after-checkpoint. These are two distinct commands, deliberately worded
  differently in the UI.
- **The head moves only under compare-and-swap.** A finished agent run creates a
  *candidate* and never selects itself — which is what makes out-of-order
  completions safe.

Why references rather than copies: per-step verdicts are keyed to the step UUID, so
an annotator's completed review survives a re-fork. Copying would mint new ids and
silently discard their work.

### 4.3 Checkpoints and replay

A **checkpoint** (`app/checkpoints.py`) captures a complete restorable point: the
world, backend state, URL, the full tab list, cookies, storage, scroll, viewport,
DPR, and normalized hashes of the world and DOM.

The world hash normalizes away things that churn without meaning: `flash_messages`
and `action_log` at every nesting level, key ordering, and integral floats (a world
stored in a JSON column returns `0.0` where the live gym reports `0`).

`app/replay.py` is the gate that makes a golden trustworthy:

1. Restore the branch's starting checkpoint
2. Execute each committed action *structurally* — never via an LLM
3. Compare world hashes after every action
4. **Reject on divergence**

Rejecting is the point. An annotator who explores their way into a state and then
commits only the last click has a sequence that does not reproduce; the gate
refuses it and names the step that broke.

### 4.4 The live browser

`live_browser/service.py` in the gym repo streams a real Chromium over CDP.

- **Coordinates are normalized 0..1, never pixels.** The rendered canvas is almost
  never the viewport size, so pixels would silently mis-place every click.
- **Short-lived HMAC tickets**, origin allow-list, exactly one controller at a time,
  monotonic acknowledged input ids.
- **Structured actions** (`/act`) mirror the agent harness vocabulary exactly, so a
  human-authored golden replays in the same benchmark that runs agents.
- **Opening a session seeds the gym** to the attempt's `(task, seed)` and lands the
  browser on the task's own start URL. The gym holds one global session per
  process and keeps whatever the last caller left in it, so without this the
  annotator drives some other task's world entirely.
- `/focused` reports which element has keyboard focus — the client cannot infer it,
  and mis-attributing a keystroke defeats the backend's redaction of sensitive
  fields.

### 4.5 Finalization — the gates before anything ships

`app/finalize.py`. All of these must pass:

| Gate | Refuses when |
|---|---|
| Ownership | The version or suite belongs to another attempt |
| QC | The version is not `approved` |
| Verdicts | The version still contains a step marked *wrong* |
| Replayability | Any step lacks a semantic locator (`navigate`/`press` exempt) |
| Clean replay | The trajectory does not reproduce from a **fresh reset** — not a checkpoint |
| Score | The run fails its own suite (unless shipped deliberately as a breaker) |
| Immutability | The attempt is already submitted |

On success it binds `BenchmarkRun → version + suite + final checkpoint` and
`Submission → task revision + approved version + benchmark run`, then **freezes** the
whole deliverable into a snapshot so later edits to the suite or a re-captured
canonical run cannot rewrite what shipped.

### 4.6 Supporting subsystems

| Subsystem | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/canonical.py` | Binds *which recorded run is canonical* for a task, explicitly, rather than guessing by timestamp |
| `app/disposition.py` | The six-way taxonomy answering *whose failure was it* — `model_failure`, `task_unsolvable`, `environment_broken`, `seed_invalid`, `instruction_ambiguous`, `verifier_invalid` — proposed by the annotator, adjudicated by a reviewer |
| `app/workspace/` | Per-attempt isolated gym processes (the gym holds one global session per process). **Off by default** |
| `app/backfill.py` | Reconstructs per-step world trails for archived runs by replaying them |
| `app/agent_runs.py` | Durable agent branch jobs with idempotency, heartbeats and rerun-cap accounting |

---

## 5. The product: what a shipped sample contains

This is the actual deliverable — schema `golden-sample/2`:

```jsonc
{
  "sample_id": "…", "schema": "golden-sample/2",
  "task":        { "id", "revision", "prompt", "category", "difficulty",
                   "constraints", "allowed_sites", "seed" },
  "initial_state": { /* the full seeded world */ },
  "recorded_trajectory": [ /* the original failing run */ ],
  "trajectory_version": { "id", "version_no", "kind",
                          "environment_image_digest", "lineage": [...] },
  "corrections":   [ /* which versions corrected what */ ],
  "golden_trajectory": [ {
      "idx", "stepId", "actor",        // agent | human — hybrid runs are labelled per step
      "type", "description",
      "locator":  { "testId": "input-compose-subject" },   // replayable, not pixels
      "resolved": { /* what actually matched at dispatch */ },
      "args":     { "selector", "value" },
      "url", "screenshot",
      "reasoning", "human_intent", "guidance",             // provenance, never synthesized
      "world_hash"                                          // the state this step produced
  } ],
  "verifiers": [ { "id", "level", "assertion", "check", "gym_result", "added_by_human" } ],
  "verifier_suite_version": 1,
  "reward": 0,
  "final_world_hash": "b3eed0d9…",
  "submission": { "reward", "kind", "accepted", "benchmark_run_id", "at" },
  "annotator": "…",
  "metadata": { "source", "agent", "status", "created_at" }
}
```

Three properties make it usable by a recipient:

1. **Every action carries a semantic locator**, so it replays after layout change.
2. **Every step names its actor** — a corrected run is routinely hybrid (agent
   prefix, human suffix), and the export says which is which.
3. **The end state is hashed**, so the recipient can verify the trajectory arrives
   where we claim.

## 6. Data model

21 tables. The load-bearing ones for the correction workflow:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    TASK ||--o{ REVIEW_SESSION : "annotated by"
    ANNOTATOR ||--o{ REVIEW_SESSION : owns
    REVIEW_SESSION ||--o{ TRAJECTORY_VERSION : "lineage"
    REVIEW_SESSION ||--o{ TRAJECTORY : "recorded runs"
    TRAJECTORY ||--o{ TRAJECTORY_STEP : contains
    TRAJECTORY_VERSION ||--o{ TRAJECTORY_STEP : "owns suffix"
    TRAJECTORY_STEP ||--o| ENVIRONMENT_CHECKPOINT : "before / after"

    REVIEW_SESSION ||--o{ SUBMISSION : ships

    REVIEW_SESSION ||--o{ WORKSPACE_LEASE : "isolated gym"
    REVIEW_SESSION ||--o{ INTERACTION_EVENT : "raw capture"
```

Two separations worth understanding:

- **`InteractionEvent` vs `TrajectoryStep`.** Raw exploration is append-only and
  never becomes a step on its own. Only what the human *commits* becomes a
  trajectory step. This is what lets an annotator explore freely without polluting
  the golden.
- **`ReviewSession` is the attempt.** It carries `active_version_id` (the head),
  `revision` (the optimistic lock), `agent_call_count` (the rerun budget) and the
  disposition columns.

Schema is managed by Alembic — **13 migrations**, head `c9d0e1f2a3b4`, and the dev
database matches.

## 7. Running it

```bash
# 1. the gym (repo: ecommerce-browser-gym)
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn server.main:app --port 8000

# 2. the live browser service (same repo, separate process — it owns a Chromium)
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn live_browser.service:app --port 8877

# 3. the annotator stack (repo: browser-gym-annotator)
cd infra && docker compose up -d       # frontend :8080 · backend :8090 · postgres :5433
```

| Service | Port | Required for |
|---|---|---|
| gym | 8000 | Everything |
| live browser | 8877 | The live pane, manual capture, **finalization** |
| backend | 8090 | The API |
| frontend | 8080 | The UI |
| postgres | 5433 | Persistence |

The backend runs containerised while the gym and browser run on the host, so it
reaches the gym at `host.docker.internal` while the *browser* must be told the
host-side name — `GYM_HOST_FOR_BROWSER`. Only the host is rewritten, never the
port; the port is what workspace isolation uses.

Tests:

```bash
cd backend  && .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q      # 393 passing
cd frontend && npm run test                        # 160 passing
```

Two end-to-end smoke scripts live in `backend/scripts/smoke/` and run against the
**live stack** (they mutate the dev database):

- `smoke.py` — 23 checks: services, catalog, versioning, CAS, gates, ownership, live browser
- `smoke2.py` — 14 checks: suite → approve → replay → score → bind → freeze → export

---

## 8. Current state — measured, not asserted

### What works end to end

Proven against the running stack on 2026-07-24: **23/23** platform checks and
**14/14** shipping checks. A real sample exported as `golden-sample/2`, bound to
its version, per-step actor recorded, end state hashed, immutable afterwards.

### The data readiness gap — the real bottleneck

| | Count |
|---|---|
| Tasks registered in the gym | 312 |
| Tasks with an archived recorded run **on disk** | **315** |
| Archived trajectory files | 4,760 |
| Tasks with a canonical run **ingested into the platform** | **12** |
| Trajectory steps in the platform | 273 |
| …carrying a semantic locator (replayable) | 31 |
| …carrying `world_after` (forkable) | 54 |

**The runs exist; they have not been ingested.** This is an ingestion gap, not a
capture gap, and it is the single largest thing standing between the platform
working and the platform being useful. Everything downstream — annotator
throughput, the 85-breaker report, benchmark scale — is gated on it.

### Replay-backfill coverage

`app/backfill.py` reconstructs missing world trails by replaying archived runs at
zero model cost. Measured across all 315 archived tasks in one pass:

| | |
|---|---|
| Steps replayed | 8,306 |
| Steps executed | 5,314 (64%) |
| Steps accepted | 4,953 (60%) |
| Tasks fully covered | 91 |
| Tasks partly covered | 203 |
| Tasks not covered | 21 |

The 40% shortfall is dominated by the random-id problem (§3.4), not by the clock.

Full detail: [`docs/preflight-world-trail.md`](./preflight-world-trail.md).

### Known incomplete

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Workspace isolation | Implemented and tested, **off by default**. Until it is on, opening a live browser reseeds the *shared* gym — fine for one annotator, not for two at once |
| Rerun cap | Implemented, **off by default** (`agent_run_cap=0`) — correctly, until manual fallback is proven at scale |
| Scheduled-event replay | 18 tasks need clock ticks; auto-detected, but those tasks have no recorded world to verify against |
| Legacy v1 correction path | Fenced off in the UI for versioned attempts; code still present for pre-v2 attempts |
| Frontend a11y | Version-graph path converted to real buttons; ~27 spans/divs remain in `TaskReview.tsx` chrome |
| Deployment | Local docker-compose only; `infra/deploy-gcp.sh` exists but is unexercised this cycle |

---

## 9. Corrections to earlier claims

Prior documentation and meeting notes contain figures that no longer hold. Correcting
them here so they are not propagated:

| Claim | Where | Reality |
|---|---|---|
| "234 tasks in the gym" | gym `README.md` | **312** registered in the live registry |
| Verifiers "never read the URL" | gym `README.md` | **50 of 284 suites** read `p.url`/`active_tab_url`. The claim is false as stated |
| "End-state verifiers" | annotator `README.md`, meeting notes | **Trajectory-evaluated**, sticky milestones. 82% are also end-state-satisfiable; 18% are not |
| "M57 fails because of the scheduled-event clock" | earlier preflight notes | M57 has an **empty schedule queue**. Its failure is the random-id problem |

None of these change what the system does — they change how we describe it, which
matters most when a partner team is building on our description.

**Planned:** the annotator splits into separate front-end and back-end repositories
(2026-07-24 decision) to enable parallel development. The boundary is already clean
— `frontend/` talks to `backend/` only over HTTP, with no shared build.

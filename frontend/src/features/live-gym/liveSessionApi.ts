/**
 * The attempt's live browser session, as minted by the annotator backend.
 *
 * The backend mints it rather than this client for two reasons that both fail
 * silently if got wrong. It is the only side that knows which gym this attempt
 * runs against (its own isolated workspace endpoint, else settings.gym_url), and
 * it is the only side that can say who the signed-in annotator is. The live
 * service closes the stream 4401 when a ticket's owner is not the owner its
 * session was minted for, and a 4401 looks exactly like a stream that never
 * started — so neither the URL nor the owner is a client input here.
 *
 * Not built on lib/api.ts: those helpers collapse every failure into null, and
 * "the live browser service is unreachable" (409) is the one failure an
 * annotator can act on themselves. Collapsed into null it reads as a broken
 * pane, and they go looking for a bug that isn't there.

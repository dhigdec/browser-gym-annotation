"""Canonical-run binding (§3.10).

Which recorded run a gym task is annotated against was decided by a heuristic —
"the oldest gym trajectory carrying a replay payload" — copied into four modules.
For M40_bogus_pricematch and M76_ambiguous_subscription_cancel that heuristic
pins a run captured BEFORE per-step world capture existed: it has no world trail,
so "correct step N and drive forward" silently resumes from the run's FINAL world
(every later step's effects already applied) and a fork has no checkpoint to
restore from. Meanwhile a newer, complete run sits in the same table, ignored.

These tests hold the two properties that fix it: an explicit binding is the
source of truth, and the fallback prefers a run that can actually be forked from.

"""Deterministic replay — the gate a trajectory must pass before it is golden.

A human explores, then proposes a sequence of actions to COMMIT. That proposal is
a claim, not a fact: it routinely depends on state the exploration created and the
commit discarded (a dropdown that was opened, a filter that was applied, a tab
that was switched). Replay is how we find out, per §3.6:

    ① restore the parent checkpoint into a clean environment
    ② execute each committed action, structurally — never an LLM
    ③ compare world hashes after every action
    ④ reject on divergence or on an action that did not land
    ⑤ only a validated sequence becomes the new committed head

Rejecting is the point. A trajectory that "mostly replays" is worse than none: it
ships as ground truth and then fails to reproduce for whoever trains on it.

    recording captured, so EVERY hash comparison fails and a perfectly good

    can never reproduce what it wrote — the same write-path/read-path split that

    `sched.now` before consulting the queue and `now` is inside the hashed world,

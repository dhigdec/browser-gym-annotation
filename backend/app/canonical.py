"""Which recorded run IS the canonical run for a task (§3.10).

Every annotator reviewing a breaker reviews the SAME run. That run was chosen by
a heuristic — "the oldest gym trajectory carrying a replay payload" — copied into
four modules, which is how the four copies drifted apart (one has no LIMIT, three
apply LIMIT 50 before testing for a payload, and export disagrees with the version
graph about which of a session's own rows is "the" one).

The heuristic is also wrong on its own terms. Per-step world capture landed in
the gym harness after some runs were already recorded, so the OLDEST run is
routinely the one with no world trail — and a canonical run with no world trail
cannot be forked from at all: `gym._persist_gym_review` writes no per-step
checkpoint, `versions.fork_before` gets `fork_checkpoint_id=None`, and
`replay.restore_and_replay` then skips restoration entirely and reports success
against whatever state the environment happens to be in. Nothing raises. A
post-wipe re-capture is a NEW stochastic run, not a fresher copy of the old one,
so "oldest" is not even a conservative choice — it is an arbitrary one.

So canonical is BOUND, not guessed:

* an explicit `CanonicalRun` row is the source of truth, and nothing derived from
  timestamps or payload shape may override it;
* with nothing bound, the fallback prefers a run that is actually forkable (has a
  world trail), then the earliest such run so canonical stays stable, then the
  longer trace, then the id — because two runs recorded in the same second are
  indistinguishable by clock and the answer must not depend on the order the
  storage engine happens to return rows in;
* an attempt already baselined keeps the base bound on its v1
  (`TrajectoryVersion.base_trajectory_id`, which existed for exactly this and was
  never read back), so re-binding a task cannot swap the run out from under a
  half-finished review.

`audit()` measures world coverage per task rather than asserting it from the
schema (§8.7), and the CLI at the bottom is how M40/M76-style mistakes get
corrected:

    python -m app.canonical audit --limit 50
    python -m app.canonical candidates --task M40_bogus_pricematch
    python -m app.canonical bind --task M40_bogus_pricematch --best \\
        --actor reviewer@deccan.ai --reason "pre-world-capture run was pinned"

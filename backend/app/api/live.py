"""Live browser sessions — the ticket the pane cannot mint for itself.

A live stream is a remote-control channel, so the live browser service authorises
it with an HMAC ticket signed over ``session_id:owner:exp``. The pane cannot
produce one: minting needs the signing secret AND knowledge of who is signed in,
and only this process has both. Until something mints tickets, the pane has no
session id and no ticket, so it cannot be used at all.

Two rules here are the difference between a working pane and a frozen one:

* The owner is the signed-in annotator's email. The service closes the socket
  4401 when a ticket's owner is not the owner its session was opened for, and a
  socket closed after a successful handshake looks exactly like a hung stream.
* One browser per attempt, re-attached rather than re-opened. A reload that
  opened its own Chromium would leak one per refresh, which exhausts the box long
  before an annotator finishes a task.

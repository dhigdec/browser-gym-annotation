"""Disposition endpoints — propose, adjudicate, and count.

The annotator proposes on their OWN attempt (ownership 404s, never 403s, so an
attempt id cannot be used to probe for other people's work); a reviewer rules on
somebody else's. The aggregate is the endpoint the 85-task report is waiting on:
it is what turns a pile of failed attempts into "n of these were the model and m
of these were us".

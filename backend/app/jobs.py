"""Background job registry for slow work (a gym browser run, an agent branch)
that must run OFF the HTTP request path.

The in-process dict is a CACHE. The RECORD is a `background_job` row.

Why that way round. A jobId outlives the process that minted it. A gym run takes
up to four minutes and the client polls for five, treating any non-200 as a
transient blip and simply retrying (`pollGymJob`, frontend/src/lib/api.ts:398).
While `get()` looked only in process memory, every restart turned every
outstanding job into a 404 "unknown or expired job" — for runs that had already
finished, and for runs still executing. Nothing raised and nothing logged: the
annotator watched a spinner reach its own timeout and the result was lost.

Why a table of its own rather than AgentRunJob rows. AgentRunJob is the durable
record of ONE handoff — an agent branch run against an attempt — and it is the
ledger the rerun cap is charged from (`counts_against_cap`). Four of the five
kinds submitted here (run-review, capture-seeds, autogen-verifiers, resume-run)
have no attempt at all and return payloads it has nowhere to put, so hosting them
there would mean a nullable attempt_id, a kind column and a result column bolted
onto the cap ledger — non-agent work sitting inside an annotator's run budget,
where a miscount is invisible until somebody is refused a run they never used.
The two records stay distinct, and this store only ever READS AgentRunJob (see
`_from_agent_run`), so a poll of a run id still answers truthfully.

The model lives in this module, beside the store that owns it, the same way
`CanonicalRun` lives in app/canonical.py beside its resolver.

ONE WORKER. A single uvicorn process owns every thread it starts, which is what
lets `recover_orphans()` conclude that a non-terminal row stamped with an older
boot id has no worker. Running more than one worker means replacing that boot-id
test with a heartbeat lease — the boot id is here so that change stays local.

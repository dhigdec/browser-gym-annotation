"""Disposition — the workflow that answers "whose failure was it?".

A failed attempt tells a report nothing until someone says WHY it failed: the
model got it wrong, or the harness never gave it a chance. Today that answer is
a boolean at best, which is why 85 breaker tasks sit un-analysable — "failed"
cannot be separated from "unsolvable", "seeded wrong", or "the verifier was
lying". This module makes the answer an adjudicated record instead of a flag.

Three rules make the record worth trusting:

* **A disposition is proposed, not declared.** The annotator who ran the attempt
  proposes a value with a note and evidence; a REVIEWER rules on it. The one
  person with a motive to blame the environment is the person whose attempt just
  failed, so their word alone must not become the dataset's answer.
* **A claim against the harness carries evidence.** Every value except
  `model_failure` blames something the annotator does not own, so it must cite at
  least one real Artifact or EnvironmentCheckpoint row. An unevidenced
  "environment_broken" is indistinguishable from a shrug, and a report built out
  of shrugs is worse than no report — it would send someone hunting a bug that
  was never there.
* **It names WHICH environment.** "the environment was broken" is meaningless
  without the image digest and task revision it was broken in: a fix would have
  nothing to verify against, and a re-run would silently prove the wrong thing.
  Both are stamped onto the event as it is recorded, never re-derived afterwards
  — by then the workspace has moved on and the answer would be a guess.

State lives on the columns ReviewSession already carries; the workflow itself —
every proposal, ruling, rework round, note and citation — is an append-only
ledger in `audit_log`, the table this codebase already writes on every mutation.
An attempt's STANDING is derived from the columns alone, so it survives even if
the ledger is trimmed for retention:

    disposition IS NULL                ->  undisposed
    disposition_by_id == annotator_id  ->  proposed    (the annotator's claim)
    disposition_by_id != annotator_id  ->  adjudicated (a reviewer ruled)

A reviewer may never adjudicate their own attempt, which is the whole reason
that last line can be trusted as a proxy for "someone independent looked".

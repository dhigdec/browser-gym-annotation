"""Workspace lease lifecycle.

Two runtime types, and they are never shared:

* **Human workspace** — long-lived, leased to an attempt for the duration of the
  annotator's work. This is what the live browser attaches to.
* **Agent branch worker** — short-lived, provisioned from a checkpoint for one
  batch run and torn down. An agent run must NEVER execute against the human's
  workspace: the gym has one global ``SESSION`` per process, so a run would reset
  the world out from under the annotator mid-review.

Leases live in Postgres rather than process memory, so a backend restart can
reconcile (or reclaim) what it previously spawned instead of leaking processes.
TTL is INACTIVITY-based and extended by human control or a running job, so a
long-but-active annotation is never reaped mid-work.
